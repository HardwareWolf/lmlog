# LMLog Phase 1 Implementation - Changelog

## Version 0.3.0 - Performance & Feature Additions

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- **324% faster synchronous logging** - Critical for high-throughput applications where logging can't block main execution
- **381% faster asynchronous logging** - Enables non-blocking logging for real-time systems and web applications  
- **Reduced time per operation from 101Œºs to 24Œºs** - Dramatically reduces CPU overhead and improves application responsiveness
- **Memory efficiency** - Object pooling eliminates allocation overhead, reducing garbage collection pressure

| Implementation Stage | Ops/sec | Time/op (Œºs) | Improvement |
|---------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Baseline | 9,884 | 101.2 | - |
| Stage 1 | 23,799 | 42.1 | 140% faster |
| **Stage 2** | **41,949** | **23.9** | **324% faster** |

**Async Performance:**
| Implementation Stage | Ops/sec | Time/op (Œºs) | Improvement |
|---------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Baseline Async | 4,749 | 210.6 | - |
| **Stage 2 Async** | **22,849** | **43.8** | **381% faster** |

### üÜï New Features

#### **1. Object Pooling System**
Eliminates memory allocations during logging by reusing objects. Critical for high-frequency logging scenarios.
```python
from lmlog.pools import ObjectPool, get_event_pool, get_string_pool
# Pools automatically manage object lifecycle to prevent memory leaks
```

#### **2. Adaptive Sampling**
Intelligently reduces log volume based on system load and event frequency. Prevents log flooding while maintaining observability.
```python
from lmlog.sampling import create_smart_sampler, AdaptiveSampler
sampler = create_smart_sampler(target_rate=1000)  # Keeps top 1000 events/sec
# Automatically adjusts sampling rate based on traffic patterns
```

#### **3. Async Processing with Circuit Breaker**
Enables non-blocking logging with automatic failure protection. Prevents logging issues from cascading to your application.
```python
from lmlog.async_processing import AsyncEventQueue, CircuitBreaker
# Handles bursts of log events without blocking application threads
# Circuit breaker prevents system overload during high traffic
```

#### **4. OpenTelemetry Integration**
Automatically correlates logs with distributed traces. Essential for debugging microservices and distributed systems.
```python
from lmlog.otel_integration import extract_trace_context
# Logs automatically include trace_id, span_id, and baggage
# Enables seamless correlation between logs, metrics, and traces
```

#### **5. High-Performance Logger**
Drop-in replacement with all performance improvements enabled by default. Maintains full API compatibility.
```python
from lmlog import LMLogger

logger = LMLogger(
    output="app.jsonl",
    async_processing=True,        # Non-blocking writes
    encoder="msgspec",           # Fastest JSON serialization
    max_events_per_second=1000   # Intelligent rate limiting
)
# Same methods as before, 324% faster performance
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Techniques

- **Object pooling** - Reuses log event objects to eliminate allocation overhead in hot paths
- **String interning** - Caches frequently used strings to reduce memory footprint
- **Intelligent batching** - Groups log writes to minimize I/O operations and improve throughput
- **LRU caching** - Caches caller information to avoid expensive stack introspection
- **Circuit breaker pattern** - Prevents logging failures from impacting application performance
